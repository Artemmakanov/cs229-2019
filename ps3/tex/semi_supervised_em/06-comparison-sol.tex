\begin{answer}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Semi-supervised takes significantly fewer iteration to convergence.
    \item Semi-supervised is much more stable than clear unsupervised.
    \item I Think, the unsupervised settings clusters dots softly, while semi-supervised setting forces algorithm to follow som strict pattern of gaussians.
\end{enumerate}
